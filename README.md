## fbm_predictor.ipynb

The fbm_predictor.ipynb notebook contains the Python code created for the Extended Research Project. It contains the analysis, modelling, and predictions.

## Models

**Models/:** This directory contains pre-trained models to make the Hurst exponent predictions. The file 'model.keras' is the model trained on Fractional Brownian Motion trajectories with varying generalised diffusion coefficients. The file 'baseline_model.keras' is the baseline model trained on Fractional Brownian Motion trajectories with a fixed generalised diffusion coefficient.

## Datasets

**Experimental Dataset/:** This directory contains the endosome trajectory 'traj_rab5.csv''dataset analysed in the Extended Research Project.

**Validation Datasets:/** This directory contains the validation datasets simulating different trajectory scenarios used to validate and test the models
